Let there exist a country with N cities and M bidirectional roads connecting the cities. Each road is either of the following three types.

Passenger transportation road (Type 0) - Only lets the passenger vehicles pass through.
Cargo transportation road (Type 1)- Only lets the cargo vehicles pass through.
Passenger + cargo transportation road (Type 2)- Lets Both passenger and cargo vehicles pass through.
The cities are numbered from 0 to N-1.

We need to find the maximum number of roads that can be closed down, and all the cities still remain connected for both passenger and cargo transportation.
